This is a simple pathfinding game made using pygame and [pathfinding module](https://pypi.org/project/pathfinding/). In this game, the player can choose the location for roomba to move in the room. Then the screen will show the path calculated by [A* search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) and the roomba will follow the path.
