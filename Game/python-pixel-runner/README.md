This game is created using pygame. The goal for the game is simple. The player uses jump to aviod obstacles like flies and snails and try to last longer to get higher scores.

## What I learned from this project
I use [sprite](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html) class to create player and obstacles, which makes it easy to control the movement and animation of game sprites.

I use list to include different images for game sprite, then I change index back and forth to choose image from the list. By doing above, I can animate sprite.
